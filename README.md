# Note-Taker

## Description 
This weeks homework was to modify a starter code and create an application called Note Taker, that can be used to write & save notes.
This application will use Express.js and will save and retrive notes via a JSON file.
We then had to deploy the app to Heroku.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```

This application was created to generate a team profile based on user input using the Inquirer module from Node.js and displaying the information on a newly created html page with a style sheet. 
This project demonstrates use of OOP and TDD using Jest. 

## Installation 
The user should clone the repository from GitHub and download Node. This application also requires express and can be run via `npm install`. 

## Deployment
You can view my live application here - [Heroku](https://intense-ravine-90141.herokuapp.com/)<br>

## Screenshots
Below you will see my deployed app on Heroku working:
